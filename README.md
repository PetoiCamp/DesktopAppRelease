# DesktopAppRelease
This repo makes the Petoi Desktop App independent from the original [OpenCat](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat-Quadruped-Robot) project. You can find the previous releases in that project. 

## Introduction
Petoi Desktop App provides a neat graphical user interface to configure the firmware, calibrate the robot, and design customized motions for your robot. The major function modules are the Firmware Uploader, Joint Calibrator, Skill Composer and Debugging Tools.
